Write a function that plays five rounds of Rock Paper Scissors. 
The function should take two parameters 
- the playerSelection and computerSelection 
- and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so:
 "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
make your function case insensitive 
(so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation)
